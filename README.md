# QuickReport

## Summary

QuickReport is a full-stack PERN app designed to help nurses and other healthcare professionals take report (gather details) on their patients.

The QuickReport client-side allows users to view, create, edit and delete multiple patient reports. The connected API was also written by me and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SabrinaSides/quick-report-api).
